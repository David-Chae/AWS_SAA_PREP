Knowledge of:
• Access controls and management across multiple accounts
• AWS federated access and identity services (for example, AWS Identity and Access Management [IAM], AWS IAM Identity Center [AWS Single Sign-On])
• AWS global infrastructure (for example, Availability Zones, AWS Regions)
• AWS security best practices (for example, the principle of least privilege)
• The AWS shared responsibility model


Let’s break down **Domain 1.1: Design Secure Access to AWS Resources** clearly and concisely, focusing on exactly what you need to understand for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification. 
Here’s an **outline** of the knowledge you should have:

---

### ✅ 1️⃣ Access controls and management across multiple accounts

* **AWS Organizations**:

  * What it is and why it’s used (account isolation).
  * Organizational Units (OUs) and Service Control Policies (SCPs).
* **Cross-Account Access**:

  * IAM roles and role assumption.
  * Trust policies and permission boundaries.
* **Account structures**:

  * Centralized security or auditing account.
  * Resource sharing via Resource Access Manager (RAM).
* **Best Practice**:

  * Isolate environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
  * Minimize the use of the root account.

---

### ✅ 2️⃣ AWS Federated Access and Identity Services

* **IAM**:

  * Creating and managing users, groups, roles, policies.
* **AWS Identity Center (AWS SSO)**:

  * Federated access across AWS accounts and connected SaaS.
  * Integrate external identity providers (e.g., Azure AD, Okta).
* **Federation Techniques**:

  * SAML 2.0 federation.
  * OpenID Connect (OIDC).
* **Best Practice**:

  * Minimize long-lived credentials.
  * Use temporary credentials via STS.

---

### ✅ 3️⃣ AWS Global Infrastructure

* Understanding:

  * AWS Regions (discrete geographic areas).
  * Availability Zones (independent data centers).
* **Why it matters for security**:

  * Isolation of resources across Regions/AZs.
  * Compliance and data residency requirements.

---

### ✅ 4️⃣ AWS Security Best Practices

* **Principle of Least Privilege**:

  * Grant only the permissions required.
* **Security Layers**:

  * Identity and access.
  * Infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups).
  * Encryption at rest/in transit.
* **Additional Practices**:

  * Enable MFA.
  * Use IAM roles instead of long-term access keys.
  * Enable logging and monitoring (CloudTrail, AWS Config).
  * Use service-linked roles where available.

---

### ✅ 5️⃣ The AWS Shared Responsibility Model

* **What AWS is responsible for**:

  * “Security of the cloud” (global infrastructure, hardware, data centers).
* **What you are responsible for**:

  * “Security in the cloud” (user access, data protection, firewall configuration).
* Be able to **articulate examples**:

  * AWS: Manages hypervisor patches.
  * You: Manage OS patches for EC2 instances.
  * AWS: Secures the underlying storage infrastructure.
  * You: Configure S3 bucket policies correctly.
